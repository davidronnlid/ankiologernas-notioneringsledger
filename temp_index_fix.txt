Looking for these problematic lines in index.tsx:

Expected around lines 903-907:
    // Initialize development user safely on client-side
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
      dispatch(initializeDevelopmentUser());
    }
  }, [dispatch]);

Should become:
  }, []);

The issue is that git thinks the file is clean but the build is still failing.
